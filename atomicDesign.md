# Atoms
Basic building blocks of matter, such as a button, input or a form label. They’re not useful on their own.
# Molecules
Grouping atoms together, such as combining a button, input and form label to build functionality.
# Organisms
Combining molecules together to form organisms that make up a distinct section of an interface (i.e. navigation bar)
# Templates
Consisting mostly of groups of organisms to form a page — where clients can see a final design in place.
# Pages
An ecosystem that views different template renders. We can create multiple ecosystems into a single environment — the application.
